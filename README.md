# I. QoE User Study

This repository gives guidance for running a crowdsourced user study on Web QoE. A user study consists of two steps: first is to create videos of page loads, and the second is collect user ratings on page load videos and analyze the data. 



## Step 1: Create Page Load Videos
Because crowdworkers have very different network setup, they have completely different page load experience if we just ask them to load an actual web page. Instead, the common techinique is to record a video of page load and let crowdsourced workers rate the quality of page load process shown in the video.
